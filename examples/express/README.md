# Taskless & Express Using `taskless/express`

This is an example of using the Taskless.io client in an Express application. Please see [routes/queues/sample.ts](./routes/queues/sample.ts) for how to set up the queue, and [routes/run-sample.js](./routes/run-sample.js) for an example of triggering a queue.

To run:

1. create a `.env.local` file with the necessary values
2. run `yarn start`
3. visit `http://localhost:3000/run-sample` with your browser or wget the url with `wget http://localhost:3000/run-sample` from a terminal window
