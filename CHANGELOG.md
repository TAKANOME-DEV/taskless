Packages in this repository are synchronized on release, with a single changelog across all pacakges. This changelog is specifically limited to items in the `packages/` folder.

# 1.2.0 (upcoming)

#### ðŸŽ‰Features

- **@taskless/client** Adds the ability to specify an array as a job identifier instead of just a string key, making namespacing identifiers a bit less cognitive overhead
- **@taskless/client** (express) Adds a `mount` method for working with Taskless when it's attached to a sub-router.
- **@taskless/dev** Added the ability to create jobs via the Taskless dev dashboard

#### ðŸ”§ Fixes

- **@taskless/client** Fixed default export of `Queue` in CJS environments
- **@taskless/client** Fixed issue in development where a mismatched signature would throw instead of logging an error

#### ðŸŽ’ Misc

- **@taskless/dev** Switches PouchDB for [mongo-memory-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-memory-server). While it adds a bit more overhead to start up a Mongo server in development, it makes it much easier to use Mango queries for querying task and job information.
- **@taskless/client** Switched to `type` imports wherever possible. While it doesn't offer direct improvements, this matches the Typescript recommendation.
- **@taskless/client** Updates node specific modules to import from the `node:` namespace
- **@taskless/client** Moved to home in `/packages` matching its package name to reduce confusion

# 1.1.0 - released May 2, 2022

#### ðŸŽ‰Features

- **@taskless/dev** New devlopment server pages at `/` and `/logs` to mirror Taskless.io, replacing the old completed/scheduled structure
