# Introduction to Taskless

Welcome to the Taskless.io documentation!

If you're new to Taskless, we recommend starting with the **Get Started** section for your framework:

- [Next.js](./get-started/nextjs.md)
- [Express](./get-started/express.md)

If your framework isn't available, Taskless also has a [generic JavaScript client](/docs/get-started/taskless-js-client.md) and a [GraphQL endpoint](/docs/get-started/graphql.md) you can use.

### System Requirements

- [Node.js 12.22.0 or later](https://nodejs.org/)
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported
